        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg chicken pieces - mix of thighs and drumsticks with skin on</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1½ cups onion - finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup oil - vegetable oil or peanut oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>3 medium tomatoes - chopped or half tin of peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp lemongrass powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken pieces with salt, ground turmeric, and ground ginger and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan or skillet, heat the cooking oil and fry the onion and garlic well over low heat until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chilli powder, stir for a minute, then add the chicken, increase the heat, and stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>When the chicken starts to brown and begins to splutter, lower the heat, then continue to stir to prevent the chicken from sticking to the pan.</li>
            <li>When the chicken starts to stick to the pan, add half a cup of water, stir, cover with a lid, and let the chicken simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, fish sauce, and ground lemongrass, stir, then cover the lid and cook for another 10-15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>The chicken curry is ready when the clear oil has separated out and sits on top of the thick fragrant gravy beneath it.</li>
            <li>Serve with Burmese coconut rice, a relish, and salads.</li>
          </ol>
