        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic Burmese chicken curry recipe makes a fragrant gently-spiced curry
             that is perfumed with turmeric, ginger, garlic, chilli, and lemongrass. A rich curry with a moreish
              tomato-based gravy and a layer of aromatic oil thatâ€™s quickly soaked up by coconut rice, 
              it should be served with zingy salads and a relish or two.</p>
